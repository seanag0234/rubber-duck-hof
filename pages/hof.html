        <img src="../images/original.jpg" title="Classic Rubber Duck">
        <p>It would not be a rubber duck hall of fame without the original rubber duck. He was the one that started in all.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="hof2">
        <img src="../images/sherlock.jpg" title="Sherlock Holmes Rubber Duck">
        <p>This rubber duck has solved more rubber duck mysteries than any other. He is especially famous for solving the great toilet caper of 1947. What a time that was!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="hof3">
        <img src="../images/giant.jpg" title="Giant Rubber Duck">
        <p>You might think this is a fake photo. You would be wrong. This is the biggest rubber duck in the known universe dwarfing every other duck (rubber or otherwise). His size might be intimidating, but on the inside he is a big softy. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="hof4">
        <img src="../images/trump.jpg" title="Trump Rubber Duck">
        <p>I don't know if this belongs in the hall of fame or the hall of shame, but the voters put him here. This is a masterful depiction in the form of a rubber duck of our current president.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="hof5">
        <img src="../images/batman.jpg" title="Batman Rubber Duck">
        <p>Batman Ducky has saved the other ducks countless times. What he is most known for is his love for darkness and hard rock.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="hof6">
        <img src="../images/santa.jpg" title="Santa Rubber Duck">
        <p>Having brought joy to millions of rubber ducks Santa Duck is a well deserving of a spot in the hall of fame.</p>

    <div id="hof7">
        <img src="../images/astronaut.jpg" title="Astronaut Rubber Duck">
        <p class="padding-top">Astronaut Duck has gone where no other duck has ever gone. His heroic efforts have landed him in our hall of fame.</p>
